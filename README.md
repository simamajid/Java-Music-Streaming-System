Music Streaming System
Project Overview
This project is a Java-based Music Streaming System designed using Object-Oriented Programming
(OOP) principles. The system allows users to stream songs and podcasts, manage playlists, and
experience different playback rules based on their subscription type.
Features 
•	Free and Premium user accounts
•	Stream songs and podcasts
•	Playlist creation using generics
•	Personal media library per user
•	Artist and album management
•	Search functionality
OOP Concepts Used
Encapsulation (private fields, getters/setters)
•	Inheritance (User → FreeUser, PremiumUser)
•	Polymorphism (different play behaviors)
•	Abstraction (User, Media)
•	Interfaces (Playable, Searchable, Downloadable)
•	Generics (Playlist<T>, Library<T>)
How to Run the Project
1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
2. Compile all Java files
3. Run the Main  class
